## Contribute

Themes can always be improved and tweaked so please feel free to log issues and
send pull requests. However, please keep in mind that this theme strives to
remain simple and language agnostic; for example, please do not ask for
`blah.blah.php` or `blah.blah.c` scopes to be added. Also, and this is purely
personal, I'm a JavaScript developer and therefore anything that alters the
colours for the JavaScript language will receive much more scrutiny before being
merged in.

Use Microsoft's
[theme color reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference)
for UI theming help.

You'll notice that the syntax is grouped by colour instead of scope. I find this
much nicer to maintain.

Happy hacking :)
